# MW_CANet
Frequency aware high-quality computer-generated holography via multilevel wavelet learning and channel attention.

This a an __unofficial__ code of [MW_CANet](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.532049). The average PSNR of this code is 31.76 dB trained on a RTX 3060, Different GPUs will produce different results during training and inferencing. Perhaps it is a little different from original technical paper because authors do not illustrate channel number _'C'_ and other parameters. So you can adjust these unknow parameters to get better quality.

Thanks [CCNN](https://github.com/flyingwolfz/CCNN-CGH) and [MCW-Net](https://github.com/yechanp/MCW-Net) for releasing relevant code.
